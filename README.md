## A CPU-based JSON Web Token (JWT) cracker and - to some extent - scanner

`jwtcat` is a `Python script` designed to detect and exploit well-known cryptographic flaws present in JSON Web Token (JWT). These vulnerabilities, if successfully exploited by an adversary could allow authentication bypass, information disclosure and could ultimately lead to the compromise of an entire information system.

More information about JWT vulnerabilities can be found at: <https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/>

---

## Features

- Test against the following vulnerabilitie(s):
  - [CVE-2018-1000531](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-2951): JWT signature bypass due to the use of `None` hashing algorithm (`alg=none`)
- Guessing attacks against JWT private keys **signed with the HS256 hashing algorithm**:
  - Brute-force attacks
  - Wordlist attacks

---

## Requirements

`jwtcat` is written in Python 3 (and therefore **requires a minimum of `Python 3.6`**) in addition to the following libraries:

- coloredlogs: <https://pypi.org/project/coloredlogs/>
- PyJWT: <https://pypi.org/project/PyJWT/>
- tqdm: <https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/>

---

## Installation

1. Clone/download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AresS31/jwtcat
cd jwtcat
```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a new `Python` virtual environment:

   - Create the virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
   - Activate the newly created environment:
     - On POSIX: `source ./env/bin/activate`
     - On Windows: `./env/Scripts/Activate.ps1`

3. Install `jwtcat`'s dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

To get a list of options and switches use:

```bash
python jwtcat.py -h
```

To get a list of options and switches for brute force attacks:

```bash
python jwtcat.py brute-force -h
```

To get a list of options and switches for wordlist attacks:

```bash
python jwtcat.py wordlist -h
```

To test a JWT against [CVE-2018-1000531](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-2951) and HS256 brute-force attacks:

```bash
python jwtcat.py vulnerable -h
```
